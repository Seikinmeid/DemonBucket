# DemonCoin         

Demoncoin is a cryptocurrency for Demonsaw users to verify the identity of users on the demonbucket network

If you meet someone you would like to stay in contact with. You can exchange wallet addresses and the next time you connect you can make a small transacton to verify that it is the same person you previously meet.  

This is a great tool because with the anonymous nature of demonsaw it is eay for someone to connect using the same name as the person you previously meet and impersonate them. 

Any assistance in getting wallets compiled, miner scripts writen, nodes set up, etc. are greatly appreciated.
