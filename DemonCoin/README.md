###What is Demoncoins Purpose??

Demoncoin is a cryptocurrency for Demonsaw users to verify the identity of users on the demonbucket network

If you meet someone you would like to stay in contact with. You can exchange wallet addresses and the next time you connect you can make a small transacton to verify that it is the same person you previously meet.  

This is a great tool because with the anonymous nature of demonsaw it is easy for someone to connect using the same name as the person you previously meet and impersonate them. 

Demoncoin can also be used for whatever other ideas you can think of. feel free to use it as you like!

###Will Demoncoins make me rich???

Not at all!  demoncoin is intentionally developed as a coin that has allmost no chance of becoming valuable what so ever. I will be highly supprised if it ever has any value at all. 

##How can I contribute???
Use demoncoins with other members, mine demoncoins, run nodes, come up with fun ways to use the demoncoins, make a demoncoin casino???, whatever you wanna do with it!

Also, Any assistance in getting miner scripts writen, nodes set up, etc. are greatly appreciated.
