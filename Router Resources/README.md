# DemonBucket - Router Resources

###Demonsaw.xml
This is the config file currently being used on the DemonBucket Official routers with comments noting where you need to modify the file to generate a config file for your own router.

### run-demonsaw-router
This is a script (for linux routers) that will automatically restart you demonsaw router in the event of the router crashing. 

### Starting up your router using Linux CLI router
1: Upload the latest version of the Demonsaw_router, run-demonsaw-router and Demonsaw.xml
2: chmod demonsaw_router amd run-demonsaw-router
3: run the run-demonsaw-router script

TIP: Running your demonsaw router in screen allows you to reconnect to the session you are running the router in to look at error logs (because demonsaw router errors are echo'd out instead of pushed in to a log file). This is very helpfull in reducing router downtime and troubleshooting issues. 

Please submit your server @ www.demonbucket.com If you would like network file transfers from the DemonBucket network to be distributed to your server as well. The Helps the network work more efficiently by sharing the load across many servers.
